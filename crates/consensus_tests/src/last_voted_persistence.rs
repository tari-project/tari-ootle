//! Persistence regression test for `LastVoted`.
//!
//! HotStuff's safety argument requires that a node never votes twice at the same view. The
//! voter checks this via `LastVoted::get(tx, epoch)` and refuses to vote if
//! `candidate.height() <= last_voted.height()` (see
//! `crates/consensus/src/hotstuff/on_ready_to_vote_on_local_block.rs:215-237`).
//!
//! If the validator restarts between sending a vote and seeing the resulting QC, the `LastVoted`
//! record must still be on disk afterwards — otherwise the validator could legally vote a second
//! time at the same height, equivocating across restarts. This test verifies the record survives
//! a full RocksDB close/reopen cycle, and that the `should_vote` decision logic (height check)
//! comes out the way the protocol requires.
