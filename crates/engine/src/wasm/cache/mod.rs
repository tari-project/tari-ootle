//! On-disk cache for compiled wasmer modules.
//!
//! Cranelift compilation of WASM templates is expensive: ~6 MB peak heap and
//! tens of milliseconds per template, paid on every node startup. The compiled
//! output for a given `(wasm_source, engine_config)` is deterministic and
//! reusable, so it can be persisted on local disk and loaded back via
//! [`wasmer::Module::deserialize_unchecked`] in milliseconds with negligible
//! peak heap.
//!
//! The WASM source bytes themselves stay on-chain (canonical, deterministic
//! representation). This cache is strictly node-local: any corrupt or missing
//! entry falls back to a full compile from source, with no consensus
//! implication.
//!
//! Two surfaces are exposed:
//!
//! - [`WasmModuleCache`] — low-level helper for callers that sit outside a `TemplateProvider` chain (e.g. the indexer's
//!   `TemplateManager`).
//! - [`DiskCachedWasmTemplateProvider`] — a `TemplateProvider` middleware that wraps a raw `PublishedTemplate` provider
//!   and outputs `LoadedTemplate`, doing compile-or-deserialize behind the scenes.

/// An artifact is only interchangeable with a fresh compile under the exact configuration that

/// `instantiation_points`, and the metering global the artifact carries — are consensus figures.
/// A node serving an artifact built under different settings therefore charges a different fee for
/// the same transaction, or meters against a different cap, than one that compiled fresh. Deriving
/// the fingerprint is what ties the filename to those settings without anyone having to remember to
/// say so.
///
/// Every source input is a file narrow enough that each line in it decides what an artifact
/// contains, which is what [`engine_config`](super::engine_config) and
/// [`module_shape`](super::module_shape) exist as separate files for: a digest over a file is only
/// as precise as that file is narrow, and imprecision here is paid for by every node recompiling
/// every template. What is configuration rather than logic — the header layout and the limits — is
/// hashed as values instead, so restating it cannot drift from applying it.
///
/// Computed in a `const` context, so the digest is a compile-time constant and the source text it
/// reads never reaches the binary.
///
/// The wasmer version is the one input not derived here, because a crate cannot read its
/// dependencies' resolved versions and a published crate cannot reach the lockfile. Two things
/// stand in for it: wasmer's own `MetadataHeader` carries an ABI version it refuses to load across,
/// so a format change ends as a miss and a recompile; and `tari-wasmer-middlewares` pins `wasmer`,
/// `wasmer-types` and `wasmer-vm` at an exact version, so the resolved version moves only when a
