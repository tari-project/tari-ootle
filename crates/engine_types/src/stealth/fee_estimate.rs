//! Static pricing for a stealth transfer that sources its own fee.
//!
//! A wallet cannot choose a transfer's shape without knowing what the shape costs: input selection
//! targets `amount + max_fee`, so the fee decides which UTXOs are spent and whether any change is
//! left over, and a change output is another stealth output with its own verification and storage.
//! Learning the cost by dry-running resolves that fixed point over the network, a round trip per
//! iteration. [`MergedStealthTransferShape::estimate_fee`] resolves it locally instead: a builder
//! rebuilds and re-prices until a build pays for itself, paying in local proof generation rather
//! than in round trips.
//!
//! What it prices is an upper bound, never an under-estimate: a builder that settles under the real
//! charge submits a transaction that is rejected for underpayment and, a fee intent leaving no
//! checkpoint to fall back to, collects nothing. The bound is close enough to be reported as-is —
//! everything but the receipt's epoch is measured rather than stood in for, which leaves a handful
//! of microtari, and a builder that reveals the figure it settled on cannot get that back.
//! `stealth_fee_estimate.rs` in `tari_engine`'s test suite holds both properties against real
//! executions across a matrix of shapes.
