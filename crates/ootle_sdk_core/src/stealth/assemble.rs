//! Stealth statement assembly — combines the outputs and inputs statements into a complete transfer
//! statement and builds the unsigned transaction. Pure and synchronous.
//!
//! The outputs and inputs paths produce the two halves of a [`StealthTransferStatement`]; this module
//! combines them, generates the balance proof, runs two pre-flight validations
//! (`validate_balance_proof_signature` + `validate_transfer`), then assembles
//! [`Instruction::StealthTransfer`](tari_ootle_transaction) into an [`UnsignedTransaction`]. The
//! result is an opaque [`StealthPartialTransaction`] carrying the unsigned tx + the signing
//! requirements the sign/seal path needs.
//!
//! ## Semantic determinism
//!
//! Neither the aggregated bulletproof nor the balance-proof Schnorr signature is byte-stable: both
//! draw a nonce from `tari_crypto`'s / `tari_ootle_wallet_crypto`'s internal RNG, with no public seam
//! to inject a deterministic nonce. `entropy.balance_proof_nonce` is therefore reserved but **not**
//! consumed here: injecting it would require a change to the shared
//! `tari_ootle_wallet_crypto::balance_proof` leaf. The deterministic path still calls **no RNG of its
//! own** — the only randomness is inside the reused crypto leaves.
//! Everything else the deterministic path produces is byte-reproducible: the inputs/outputs
//! statements (modulo `agg_range_proof`), the instruction sequence, the bucket workspace ids, the
//! epoch window and dry-run flag.
