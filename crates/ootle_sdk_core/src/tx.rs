//! Sign → seal → BOR-encode an [`UnsignedTransaction`] into submit-ready bytes + transaction id.
//!
//! Signing always uses a fresh random Schnorr nonce (`RistrettoSchnorr::sign(secret, msg,
//! &mut rand::rng())` inside `TransactionSignature::sign_v1` / `TransactionSealSignature::sign_v1`),
//! so the sealed bytes and id are unique per call — the safe default for real submission. Nothing here
//! pins a signature nonce from a seed.
//!
//! ### The `is_seal_signer_authorized` rule
//!
//! The stock `seal()` sets `is_seal_signer_authorized = true` iff there are no authorization
//! signatures, before it computes the seal message, and that field is committed to by the seal
//! digest. The [`seal_public_transfer_with_auth`] path (which supplies its own authorizations) applies
//! the same rule explicitly before computing any message — otherwise the bytes would diverge or the
//! engine would reject.
