//! Golden-vector harness: the language-neutral fixture **format**, a **generator** that drives the
//! core to produce the `expected` bytes, and the loader/comparison helpers the **runner** uses to
//! assert the core reproduces those bytes byte-for-byte.
//!
//! Why this lives in `tests/` and not `src/`: the generator shells out to `git rev-parse HEAD` and
//! reads environment variables. That is fine for test tooling but would violate the crate's purity
//! rule (no clock / process / env in `src/`). So the harness is test-only support code.
//!
//! ## Format (one JSON file per vector, `fixtures/<group>/<name>.json`)
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "name": "sample/...",
//!   "schema_version": 1,
//!   "provenance": { "core_version": "...", "git_rev": "...", "generated_by": "..." },
//!   "operation": "build_and_encode_public_transfer",
//!   "input":   { ...fully-deterministic arguments to the core function... },
//!   "expected":{ "encoded_transaction": "<lowercase hex>", "transaction_id": "<lowercase hex>" }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! - **bytes are lowercase hex, no `0x` prefix** (mirrors the Python SDK fixtures). The byte newtypes in
//!   [`ootle_sdk_core::types::bytes`] already serialize this way; `expected` is just their hex.
//! - **`expected` is generator-owned** — never hand-edited. The generator is the only writer.
//! - **the runner compares hex strings, not parsed structures** — that is the whole point: a parsed compare would hide
//!   CBOR/encoding drift.
//! - **pinned nonce secrets are part of `input`**: without them neither `encoded_transaction` nor `transaction_id` is
//!   reproducible.
