//! The flat `extern "C"` **stealth** (confidential-transfer) surface: send (two-phase + one-shot) and
//! receive (scan). It mirrors the public-transfer surface in [`crate::c_abi`] exactly — same envelope
//! ([`OotleResult`]), same panic guard ([`guarded`]/[`flatten`]), same error-code mapping
//! ([`OotleResult::from_core_err`]), same JSON-string marshalling — only the wrapped core entry points
//! and the handle type differ.
//!
//! ## The second opaque handle
//!
//! The stealth send flow threads its own opaque handle
//! [`OotleStealthPartialTransaction`] — a **distinct** type from the public-path
//! [`OotlePartialTransaction`](crate::OotlePartialTransaction) — with its own free fn
//! [`ootle_stealth_partial_transaction_free`]. It carries two internal shapes under one opaque type:
//! the in-progress two-phase **resolver** while inputs are being fetched, then the **assembled,
//! ready-to-seal** [`StealthPartialTransaction`] once resolution completes (see the handle's docs).
//! [`ootle_build_stealth_unsigned`] returns it; [`ootle_apply_fetched_substates_stealth`] **consumes
//! and re-issues** it each round; [`ootle_seal_and_encode_stealth`] **consumes** the assembled one
//! (taken by value via `Box::from_raw`); a host that aborts the flow frees it once with the free fn.
//!
//! ## The host-driven fetch loop (mirrors the public path)
//!
//! Stealth inputs resolve exactly like public inputs: a host-driven `NeedMore { fetch_ids }`
//! convergence loop with vault/UTXO discovery **in the core**.
//! [`ootle_build_stealth_unsigned`] returns the handle **plus** a want list (in `data_json`); the host
//! fetches the wanted substates and calls [`ootle_apply_fetched_substates_stealth`], which returns
//! either `{"status":"need_more","fetch_ids":[…]}` (fetch those concrete ids and repeat) or
//! `{"status":"resolved"}` (the handle now wraps the assembled partial — seal it). The host never
//! derives substate ids or supplies the fetched inputs up front; the core hands back exactly what to
//! fetch. (The one-shot [`ootle_build_and_encode_stealth_transfer`] keeps taking everything up front —
//! it has no host to loop with.)
//!
//! ## Sensitive material is transient
//!
//! The account secret, the build seed, and the per-input spend secrets cross as lowercase-hex JSON
//! strings, are parsed into transient scalars for the duration of the call, and are dropped when it
//! returns. The facade does **not** zero them (it cannot reach into the host's `const char*`); treat
//! the host-owned argument buffers as the host's to manage.
