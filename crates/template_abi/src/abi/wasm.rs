// As of Rust 1.96, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target no longer passes `--allow-undefined` to the linker, so
// undefined symbols are hard linker errors instead of being implicitly turned into imports. These functions are
// resolved at runtime by the engine host, which provides them under the "env" module (see the wasmer `imports!`
// wiring in the engine crate), so we declare that import module explicitly.
