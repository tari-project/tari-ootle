//! The council is the component's owner rule: an m-of-n over the members' public identity badges,
//! which every transaction signer contributes to the authorization scope. Every method rule is
//! `DenyAll`, so the engine admits a call only when enough of the council signed it and no method
//! here checks a signer itself. Rotation and retirement replace that rule, which the engine gates on
//! the rule in force.
//!
//! The component is never read during transaction execution. Consensus decodes its state once per
//! epoch, when the end-of-epoch block that opens the next epoch is proposed, and the rate reaches
//! execution through the block header from there.
