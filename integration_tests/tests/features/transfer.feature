Feature: Account transfers

  Scenario: Transfer tokens to account that does not previously exist
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D

    # Publish the "faucet" template
    When I create an account ACC via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 10000 XTR

    When I create an account ACCOUNT via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 10000 XTR

    When miner MINER mines 13 new blocks
    Then VN has scanned to at least height 40
    Then indexer INDEXER has scanned to at least height 40

    When I wait for proof BURN_PROOF to confirm on wallet MINOTARI_WALLET
    When I claim burn BURN_PROOF and spend it into account ACC using wallet daemon WALLET_D

    # Wait for the wallet daemon account monitor to update the sender account information

  Scenario: Stealth transfer to account that does not previously exist
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
