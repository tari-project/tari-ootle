  Scenario: Create account and transfer faucets via wallet daemon
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D

    # Publish the "faucet" template
    When I create an account ACC via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 2 XTR
    When wallet daemon WALLET_D publishes the template "faucet" using account ACC

        # Create two accounts to test sending the tokens
    When I create an account ACC_1 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 10000 XTR
    When I create an account ACC_2 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 100000 XTR
    When I check the balance of ACC_2 on wallet daemon WALLET_D the amount is at least 10000

        # Create a new faucet component
    When I call function "mint" on template "faucet" using account ACC_1 to pay fees via wallet daemon WALLET_D with args "10000" named "FAUCET"

        # Submit a transaction manifest
    When I print the cucumber world
    When I submit a transaction manifest via wallet daemon WALLET_D with inputs "FAUCET, ACC_1" named "TX1"
  """
  let faucet = global!["FAUCET/components/faucet"];

  acc1.deposit(faucet_bucket);
  """
    When I print the cucumber world

  """
        # Check balances
        # `take_free_coins` deposits 10000 faucet tokens, allow up to 2000 in fees
    When I check the balance of ACC_1 for resource FAUCET/resources/FAUCET on wallet daemon WALLET_D the amount is exactly 0
#    When I wait for ACC_2 on wallet daemon WALLET_D to have balance eq 1000

  Scenario: Claim and transfer stealth assets via wallet daemon
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D

    # When I create a component SECOND_LAYER_TARI of template "fees" on VN using "new"
    When I create an account ACCOUNT_1 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 10000 XTR
    When I create an account ACCOUNT_2 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D

    When I burn 1000T on wallet MINOTARI_WALLET to proof BURN_PROOF for wallet daemon WALLET_D

        # unfortunately have to wait for this to get into the mempool....
    Then there is 1 transaction in the mempool of BASE_NODE within 10 seconds
    When miner MINER mines 13 new blocks
    Then VN has scanned to at least height 40

    When I wait for proof BURN_PROOF to confirm on wallet MINOTARI_WALLET

    When I claim burn BURN_PROOF and spend it into account ACCOUNT_1 using wallet daemon WALLET_D
    When I print the cucumber world
    When I check the confidential balance of ACCOUNT_1 on wallet daemon WALLET_D the amount is at least 10000

    Then I do a stealth transfer with amount 5 from ACCOUNT_1 to ACCOUNT_2 creating output OUTPUT_TX1 via the wallet_daemon WALLET_D

    When I check the balance of ACCOUNT_2 on wallet daemon WALLET_D the amount is exactly 5

  Scenario: Mint and transfer NFT
    # Initialize a base node, wallet, miner and VN
    Given a network with registered validator VAL_1 and wallet daemon WALLET_D

    # Create two accounts to test sending the tokens
    When I create an account ACC1 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D with 10000 XTR
    When I create an account ACC2 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D

    # Mint a new NFT
    When I mint a new non fungible token NFT on ACC1 using wallet daemon WALLET_D

    When I transfer 1 tokens of resource ACC1/resources/tNFT from account ACC1 to account ACC2 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D named TRANSFER
    When I check the balance of ACC2 for resource ACC1/resources/tNFT on wallet daemon WALLET_D the amount is exactly 1

  Scenario: Admin creates an API key
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
    And the user is authenticated as admin
    When the admin creates an API key named "test-agent" with scopes ["AccountInfo"]
    Then the response contains a plaintext key starting with "tak_"
    And the API key list contains a key named "test-agent"
    And the plaintext key is not in the list response

  Scenario: Non-admin cannot manage API keys
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
    And the user is authenticated as non-admin
    When the non-admin attempts to create an API key
    Then the response is a permission denied error
    When the non-admin attempts to list API keys
    Then the response is a permission denied error

  Scenario: Agent authenticates with API key
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
    And the admin has created an API key with scopes ["AccountInfo"]
    When a new client authenticates using the API key
    Then authentication succeeds and a JWT is returned
    And the agent can call accounts.get_default successfully

  Scenario: Agent is rejected for out-of-scope method
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
    And the admin has created an API key with scopes ["AccountInfo"] only
    When the agent authenticates and calls a transfer method
    Then the response is a permission denied error

  Scenario: Revoking an API key blocks new authentication
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
    And the admin has created an API key
    When the admin revokes the API key
    And a client attempts to authenticate with the revoked key
    Then the authentication is rejected

  Scenario: Admin scope requires explicit confirmation
    Given a network with registered validator VN and wallet daemon WALLET_D
    And the user is authenticated as admin
    When the admin creates an API key with Admin scope and grant_admin false
    Then the response is an AdminScopeRequiresConfirmation error
